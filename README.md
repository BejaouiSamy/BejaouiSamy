# Yo, welcome to my corner of the code-verse! ðŸ‘¾
Yo, Iâ€™m a coder with a passion for coding (?). Here, you'll find my chaotic journey through the world of code, memes, and me. ðŸš€

## About Me:
- ðŸ”¥ Coder, hip-hop head, and meme enthusiast.
- ðŸŽ¤ MF Doom is my programming soundtrack.
- ðŸ’» Building stuff, breaking things, and learning on the go.

### What can you expect here?

- Projects that are as unpredictable as a South Park plot twist. (Libft? Yeah, weâ€™ve got that.)
- Random, possibly genius, code snippets made with the precision of MF Doom's bars.
- Collaboration: If you wanna join the madness or just throw a shoutout, hit me up.
- And, of course, memes. Because if you don't laugh while coding, youâ€™re doing it wrong.

So, if you're ready to vibe to some heavy beats while hacking away, stick around and let's build some chaos. ðŸ’¥ðŸ”§# Pinned_bio
